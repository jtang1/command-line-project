# HOUSE BUDGET CALCULATOR

This house price calculator is designed to calculate the budget for a homeowner looking to move to a new house.

Assumptions:
- You are not a first-time buyer
- You intend to sell your current property and buy a new property

It calculates the proceeds from the sale of your current property, any extra cash you will put down as a deposit, and borrowing from a lender.

The amount borrowed is based on how many applicants are applying for the mortgage and their current salaries.

This calculator can also take into account if the homeowner has a Buy to Let Equity Loan with the government and what percentage of the property that the government owns.
